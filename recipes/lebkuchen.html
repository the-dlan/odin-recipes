    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lebkuchen are honey-sweetened spiced German cookies, commonly served during the Christmas season. They're similar to gingerbread cookies, but they are usually glazed and often feature nuts and candied fruits.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> &frac34; cup brown sugar </li>
        <li> &frac12; cup honey </li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> &frac12; cup dark molasses </li>
        <li> 3 cups sifted all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 &frac14; teaspoons ground nutmeg </li>
        <li> 1 &frac14; teaspoons ground cinnamon </li>
        <li> &frac12; teaspoon ground cloves </li>
        <li> &frac12; teaspoon ground allspice </li>
        <li> &frac12; teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> &frac12; cup slivered almonds </li>
        <li> &frac12; cup candied mixed fruit peel, finely chopped </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Lemon Glaze: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 egg white, beaten </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        <li> &frac12; teaspoon lemon zest </li>
        <li> 1 &frac12; cups sifted confectioner's sugar </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p> Beat brown sugar, honey, and egg in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; stir in molasses.</p>
        <p> Combine flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and baking soda in a separate bowl; stir into the molasses mixture to form a sticky dough. Stir in almonds and candied fruit peel. </p>
        <p> Cover dough and chill overnight. </p></li>

        <li><p> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Crease or line cookie sheets. </p></li>

        <li><p> Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to thickness of &frac14; inch. Cut into 2x3 inch rectangles. Place cookies 1 &frac12; inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. </p></li>

        <li><p> Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. </p></li>

        <li><p> While cookies are baking, make the glaze:</p>
        <p> Stir egg white, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a small bowl. Mix in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Brush glaze over cookies while they are still warm.  </p></li>

        <li><p> Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool and set completely before storing in a single layer in airtight containers.</p></li>
    </ol>
