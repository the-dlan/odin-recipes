    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This Italian dish is made by simmering rice in broth, while adding ingredients like vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese.</p>

    <p>Mushrooms are a great ingredient for risotto, as they add an earthy flavor that balances out a main dish of hearty meat, such as chicken, pork, or beef. This risotto can work as a side, main, or starter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>&frac13; cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p> Gather all ingredients. </li></p>

        <li><p> Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside. </li></p>

        <li><p> Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes. </li></p>

        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add &frac12; cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>

        <li><p> Continue adding broth, &frac12; cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes. </li></p>

        <li><p> Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. </p></li>

        <li><p> Season with salt and pepper; serve immediately. </p></li>
    </ol>
