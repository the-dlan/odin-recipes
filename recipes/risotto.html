    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This Italian dish is made by simmering rice in broth, while adding ingredients like vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese.</p>

    <p>Mushrooms are a great ingredient for risotto, as they add an earthy flavor that balances out a main dish of hearty meat, such as chicken, pork, or beef. This risotto can work as a side, main, or starter.</p>
